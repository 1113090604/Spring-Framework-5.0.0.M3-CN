### 19.5.3Â Additional tags facilitating development

Spring provides data binding of request parameters to command objects as described in earlier chapters. To facilitate the development of JSP pages in combination with those data binding features, Spring provides a few tags that make things even easier. All Spring tags have_HTML escaping_features to enable or disable escaping of characters.

The tag library descriptor \(TLD\) is included in the`spring-webmvc.jar`. Further information about the individual tags can be found in the appendix entitled[???](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.0.M5/spring-framework-reference/html/view.html).
