[Thymeleaf](http://www.thymeleaf.org/)is a good example of a view technology fitting perfectly in the MVC framework. Support for this integration is not provided by the Spring team but by the Thymeleaf team itself.

Configuring Thymeleaf for Spring usually requires a few beans defined, like a`ServletContextTemplateResolver`, a`SpringTemplateEngine`and a`ThymeleafViewResolver`. Please refer to the[Thymeleaf+Spring](http://www.thymeleaf.org/documentation.html)documentation section for more details.
