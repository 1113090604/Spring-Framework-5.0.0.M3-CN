### 19.4.1Â Dependencies

Your web application will need to include`freemarker-2.x.jar`in order to work with FreeMarker. Typically this is included in the`WEB-INF/lib`folder where the jars are guaranteed to be found by a Java EE server and added to the classpath for your application. It is of course assumed that you already have the`spring-webmvc.jar`in your`'WEB-INF/lib'`directory too!
